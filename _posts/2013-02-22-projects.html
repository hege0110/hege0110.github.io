<p><h2> 
DRONE++
</h2></p>

<p>
My work with drones started in high school with the Parrot A.R. Drone and the Kinect SDK in C#. From then, I have written and rewritten extensions on the project in Java, Python, Node.js and MATLAB. And I have also interfaced the drone with different types of hardware including the LEAP motion.

C# + KINECT

<p>
In high school, to complete my schools honors program requirement, we were required to complete a design project of our own with the guidance of a member of faculty. The only real requirement to the project is that it shows our interest in the subject. So I built a system that controls a quad-coptor through inputs from the Microsoft Kinect Sensor.

MATLAB + KINECT

<p>
I rewrote the drone controller and kinect interface using MATLAB. I chose to change platforms because I was looking for more robust control over the hardware and to easily apply higher level processing (image processing, basic AI)

The ARDrone controller can be found on my github page
